# Inventory Management System - Static Code Analysis Report

This project implements a simple Python-based inventory management system and demonstrates the use of static analysis tools to improve code quality, readability, and security.
The analysis was performed using Pylint, Flake8, and Bandit, and all identified issues were reviewed and fixed.

## Tools Used

**Pylint** - Detects code quality issues and enforces coding standards

**Flake8**	- Flags formatting issues and PEP 8 style violations

**Bandit** -	Identifies potential security vulnerabilities

## Key Issues Found & Fixes Applied

* Mentioned in detail in the pdf submitted.

## Improvements Achieved

* Code is now PEP 8 compliant
* No Bandit security warnings remain
* Pylint score improved (example: from ~4/10 to 8.9/10)
* Behavior is more robust and predictable
* Code readability and maintainability are significantly improved

## Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of static code analysis in improving code quality and preventing security and logic errors.
By iteratively applying fixes suggested by Pylint, Flake8, and Bandit, the codebase is now more secure, maintainable, and professional.
